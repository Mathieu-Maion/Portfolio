                <h3>GOOGLE SHEET</h3>
                <div class="theme">
                    <span id="personnel">Personal</span>
                    <span>Excel</span>
                    <span>Apps script</span>
                </div>
                <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet1">
                    At CESI, the allotted time for meals is extremely short, leaving no room to waste time deciding who to eat with and where.
                    This situation not only disrupts students' concentration but also hampers those who wish to work productively.
                    As the responsible person for food services in the FISA A3 cohort, I took the initiative to solve this problem by proposing a clever solution : using a Google Sheet.
                </p>
                <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet2">
                    The Google Sheet I created allows students to easily choose their meals with a simple click, eliminating the need for coordination with their peers.
                    Through this shared spreadsheet, each student can indicate their meal choice, which is then visible to the entire class.
                    I integrated graphs to visualize the class's food preferences. These graphs enable everyone to quickly see the most popular options,
                    facilitating decision-making. This eliminates time-consuming discussions and makes the decision-making process much faster and more efficient.
                    Additionally, I also utilized custom scripts to automate certain tasks, such as a script ensuring the automation of the reset process, which simplifies the management of the Google Sheet.
                </p>

                <img src="images/googlesheet.gif" alt="Image du projet 2">
                <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet3">
                    In addition to the Google Sheet solution for meal selection, I have also implemented a feature that allows
                    students to access the history of previous weeks' meal choices. This feature not only provides a convenient
                    way to review past preferences but also allows for valuable statistical analysis.
                </p>
                <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet4">
                    By maintaining a continuous record of meal selections, we can track trends and patterns in the choices made by the class.
                    This historical data offers insights into the group's preferences and enables the analysis of eating habits.
                    By consulting the history, students can make informed decisions based on past choices. Additionally, it facilitates
                    the identification of popular dishes and common preferences, which can aid in better menu planning in the future.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet5">
                        Additionally, the history feature also helps enforce the rules and code of conduct of the Excel.
                        It ensures that everyone adheres to the established guidelines and standards.
                        Deviations or violations can be identified, which may result in appropriate actions or sanctions in accordance with
                    </p>

                <p id="ContentProjectsGoogleSheet6">
                    In summary, by offering this innovative Google Sheet, I aimed to solve the problems of time loss and decreased concentration that can occur during mealtime at CESI.
                    This solution streamlines the meal selection process, allowing students to fully enjoy their mealtime and promoting an environment conducive to work and productivity.
